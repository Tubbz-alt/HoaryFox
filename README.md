## What is ST-Bridge

Quote from [building SMART Japan Structural Design Subcommittee](https://en.building-smart.or.jp/meeting/buildall/structural-design/) doing making specifications of ST-Bridge.

> ST Bridge is the standardized format for data sharing in Japanâ€™s structural engineering industry.
> + Simpler to use than IFC due to the clearly defined the range of use
> + Integrate Japanese original methods of drawing methodology (Grids, part placement and section annotations, reinforcement information)
> + Aim for coordination between domestic structural applications, building skeleton surveying applications, 3D Object CAD
