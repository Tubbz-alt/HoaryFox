Grasshopper Component which read ST-Bridge file(.stb) and display its model information.  
You can easily check frames and present structure frame!!  
If you need stand-alone ST-Bridge file viewer, Please see [STEVIA](https://github.com/hrntsm/STEVIA-Stb2U/wiki)

## Install

1. In Grasshopper, choose File > Special Folders > Components folder. Save the gha file there.

It supports version 1.x, version 2.x is not supported.

## What is ST-Bridge

Quote from [building SMART Japan Structural Design Subcommittee](https://en.building-smart.or.jp/meeting/buildall/structural-design/) doing making specifications of ST-Bridge.

> ST Bridge is the standardized format for data sharing in Japanâ€™s structural engineering industry.
> + Simpler to use than IFC due to the clearly defined the range of use
> + Integrate Japanese original methods of drawing methodology (Grids, part placement and section annotations, reinforcement information)
> + Aim for coordination between domestic structural applications, building skeleton surveying applications, 3D Object CAD
